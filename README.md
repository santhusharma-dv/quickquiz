Description:
Quick Quiz is a fast-paced, interactive web application built as my final project for Harvard's CS50x 2025. It challenges users with three questions covering Python, SQL, and Flask fundamentals. The goal is to reinforce key concepts from the course in a fun and engaging way. I built this project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end, and structured the logic based on what I learned about backend development and databases. The quiz provides instant feedback, tracks scores, and links to CS50 resources for deeper learning. This project helped me practice web development, user experience design, and deployment using GitHub Pages. It reflects my growth in programming and my passion for making learning interactive.Quick Quiz is a fast-paced, interactive web application built as my final project for Harvard's CS50x 2025.
