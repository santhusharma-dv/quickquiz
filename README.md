Description:
Quick Quiz is an interactive web-based quiz application built as my CS50x 2025 Final Project. The project is designed to test knowledge in Python, SQL, and Flask through a short 3-question sprint. It combines front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) with backend concepts learned in CS50, such as database management and web app structure. The quiz provides instant feedback for each answer, displays a final score summary, and encourages learners with motivational messages. It also includes links to CS50 course materials for deeper exploration. The project emphasizes responsive design, ensuring smooth performance on both desktop and mobile devices. By building Quick Quiz, I practiced integrating multiple technologies, debugging web apps, and deploying projects using GitHub Pages. This project reflects my journey through CS50, showcasing my ability to design, implement, and present a complete software solution from scratch.
