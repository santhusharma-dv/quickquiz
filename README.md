Quick Quiz

Description:
Quick Quiz is a web-based learning project I built for CS50x 2025 to reinforce core concepts from the course through a short, focused quiz. The app presents three carefully selected questions spanning Python function basics, SQL table creation, and the structure of a simple Flask application. My goal was to make revision fast, friendly, and practical, while practicing clean UI, instant feedback, and clear scoring. I implemented the front end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed accessible interactions, and ensured responsive behavior for both desktop and mobile. Although the quiz runs fully in the browser, its content reflects backend thinking from CS50, including how data is structured and how routes and logic would work in a small Flask app. Building this project helped me consolidate debugging habits, improve code organization, and practice deployment with GitHub Pages. The result is a polished, beginner-friendly tool that showcases my CS50 journey and encourages continued learning.
